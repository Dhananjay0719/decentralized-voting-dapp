# decentralized-voting-dapp
Decentralized voting dApp built with Solidity and Hardhat for transparent, tamper-evident voting in organizations. Enforces one-vote-per-wallet, emits on-chain events for auditability, and includes comprehensive Hardhat tests. Deployed on an Ethereum testnet with a minimal wallet-based frontend.
